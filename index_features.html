								<strong>Primary Attributes</strong>
								<p>The six primary attributes of the API all have unique informaiton specific to that attribute. This information is returned in JSON format by default.
								Each attribute has four primary pieces of data and are built in the structure of a linked list. The four components within the primary attributes are
								"count", "next", "previous", and "results". All calls to the API are GET requests. A GET request allows the client (the browser) to 'ask' that data
								be returned to the browser to be displayed. The primary attributes are utilized in the request to determine if people, planets, starships, species, vehicles, or 
								films need to be returned to the user.
								</p><!--<br>
								<br>
								<strong>The root URL</strong>
								</p>To access the data in SWAPI, you must use the 'root' URL. To access the data -->

							<strong>Count</strong>
							<br>
							<p>"Count" contains the number of data objects held by the attribute. For example, when accessing the base URL for the people attribute, as shown above.
							The count represents the number of characters from the Star Wars canon which have accessible date. This is an important component, as each character within
							the people attribute has a unique id. It is this id which is utilized to access the characters specific data. The beginning results for the first character
							in the people attribute is included above. This demonstartes the JSON data structure, but more on that later.

					<div class="col-lg-6">
						<blockquote>
							<strong>Next and Previous</strong>
							<br>
							<p>The "next" and "previous" components are part of a traditional in a linked list structure. As the names may suggest, these point to the next and previous objects in the
							data structure. The first object will have null for it's "previous" attribute and the last object will have null assigned to "next". This could be an
							important attribute if designing an application which moved through the data structure from one component to the next. However, the focus of implementing an
							interaction with this API through an application will be on calling individual object ids.

						<blockquote>
							<strong>Results</strong>
							<p>The "results" are the individual pieces of information about something in the Star Wars galaxy. This is the information we are really after. In the example
							above you can see the results for the first character(...people/1) in the people attribute. Results will vary for each primary attribute (planets dont have hair
							and people don't have obital periods around a star). This is an obvious but important distinction, because if you want to display the results of a search or query
							you will need to parse the data appropriately. To do this, you will need to know what data you will receive when doing an API query for people versus a starship.
							<br><br>
							The result for the starship with the id of '10' (http://swapi.co/api/starships/10/) is the object to the right in JSON notation. The result is the ship that infamously 
							made the Kessel run in 12 parsecs. While that detail is not included in our results, there is other information related to the starship which may be useful!.
							This data can be parsed and displayed to a user.
							<br><br>
							JSON notation is a standardized structure. The "title" : "description" attributes always give you the data in a structure which can be accessed, utilized, and displayed.
							SWAPI uses GET requests through URLs to return information in the application/json format by default.
